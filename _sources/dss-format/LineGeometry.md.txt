    - Description
*   - 1
    - `NConds`
    - integer
    - 0
    - 
    - Number of conductors in this geometry. Triggers memory allocations. Define first!
*   - 2
    - `NPhases`
    - integer
    - 0
    - 
    - Number of phases. All other conductors are considered neutrals and might be reduced out.
*   - 3
    - `Cond`
    - integer
    - 
    - 
    - Set this = number of the conductor you wish to define.

    - `Wire`
    - string<br>*([WireData](#WireData) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Code from WireData. MUST BE PREVIOUSLY DEFINED. no default.<br>Specifies use of Overhead Line parameter calculation,<br>Unless Tape Shield cable previously assigned to phases, and this wire is a neutral.<br>***Redundant with Wires***
*   - 5
    - `X`
    - real<br>*(on array)*
    - 
    - 
    - x coordinate.

    - `Units`
    - string<br>*(from enum. [](#enum-length-unit))*
    - 
    - 
    - Units for x and h. Initial default is "ft", but defaults to last unit defined
*   - 8
    - `NormAmps`
    - real
    - 0.0
    - 
    - Normal ampacity, amperes for the line. Defaults to first conductor if not specified.
*   - 9
    - `EmergAmps`
    - real

    - 
    - Emergency ampacity, amperes. Defaults to first conductor if not specified.
*   - 10
    - `Reduce`
    - boolean
    - False
    - 
    - Reduce to Nphases (Kron Reduction). Reduce out neutrals.
*   - 11
    - `Spacing`
    - string<br>*([LineSpacing](#LineSpacing) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Reference to a LineSpacing for use in a line constants calculation.<br>Alternative to x, h, and units. MUST BE PREVIOUSLY DEFINED.<br>Must match "nconds" as previously defined for this geometry.<br>Must be used in conjunction with the Wires property.

    - `Wires`
    - array of strings<br>*([WireData](#WireData) names)*
    - 
    - 
    - Array of WireData names for use in a line constants calculation.<br>Alternative to individual wire inputs. ALL MUST BE PREVIOUSLY DEFINED.<br>Must match "nconds" as previously defined for this geometry,<br>unless TSData or CNData were previously assigned to phases, and these wires are neutrals.<br>Must be used in conjunction with the Spacing property.
*   - 13
    - `CNCable`
    - string<br>*([CNData](#CNData) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Code from CNData. MUST BE PREVIOUSLY DEFINED. no default.<br>Specifies use of Concentric Neutral cable parameter calculation.<br>***Redundant with Wires***

    - `CNCables`
    - array of strings<br>*([CNData](#CNData) names)*
    - 
    - 
    - Array of CNData names for cable parameter calculation.<br>All must be previously defined, and match "nphases" for this geometry.<br>You can later define "nconds-nphases" wires for bare neutral conductors.<br>***Redundant with CNCable***
*   - 16
    - `TSCables`
    - array of strings<br>*([TSData](#TSData) names)*

*   - 17
    - `Seasons`
    - integer
    - 
    -

*   - 18
    - `Ratings`
    - array of reals
    - [0.0]
