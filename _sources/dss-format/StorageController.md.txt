    - `ModeDischarge`
    - string<br>*(from enum. [Discharge Mode](#enum-storagecontrollerdischarge-mode))*
    - Peakshave
    - 
    - Mode of operation for the DISCHARGE FUNCTION of this controller. <br><br>In PeakShave mode (Default), the control attempts to discharge Storage to keep power in the monitored element below the kWTarget. <br><br>In Follow mode, the control is triggered by time and resets the kWTarget value to the present monitored element power. It then attempts to discharge Storage to keep power in the monitored element below the new kWTarget. See TimeDischargeTrigger.<br><br>In Support mode, the control operates oppositely of PeakShave mode: Storage is discharged to keep kW power output up near the target. <br><br>In Loadshape mode, both charging and discharging precisely follows the per unit loadshape. Storage is discharged when the loadshape value is positive. <br><br>In Time mode, the Storage discharge is turned on at the specified %RatekW at the specified discharge trigger time in fractional hours.<br><br>In Schedule mode, the Tup, TFlat, and Tdn properties specify the up ramp duration, flat duration, and down ramp duration for the schedule. The schedule start time is set by TimeDischargeTrigger and the rate of discharge for the flat part is determined by %RatekW.<br><br>In I-PeakShave mode, the control attempts to discharge Storage to keep current in the monitored element below the target given in k-amps (thousands of amps), when this control mode is active, the property kWTarget will be expressed in k-amps. 
*   - 13

    - Time
    - 
    - Mode of operation for the CHARGE FUNCTION of this controller. <br><br>In Loadshape mode, both charging and discharging precisely follows the per unit loadshape. Storage is charged when the loadshape value is negative. <br><br>In Time mode, the Storage charging FUNCTION is triggered at the specified %RateCharge at the specified charge trigger time in fractional hours.<br><br>In PeakShaveLow mode, the charging operation will charge the Storage fleet when the power at a monitored element is below a specified KW target (kWTarget_low). The Storage will charge as much power as necessary to keep the power within the deadband around kWTarget_low.<br><br>In I-PeakShaveLow mode, the charging operation will charge the Storage fleet when the current (Amps) at a monitored element is below a specified amps target (kWTarget_low). The Storage will charge as much power as necessary to keep the amps within the deadband around kWTarget_low. When this control mode is active, the property kWTarget_low will be expressed in k-amps and all the other parameters will be adjusted to match the amps (current) control criteria.

    -

If Follow mode, Storage will be discharged to attempt to hold the load at or below the power level at the time of triggering. In Time mode, the discharge is based on the %RatekW property value. Set this to a negative value to ignore. Default is 12.0 for Follow mode; otherwise it is -1 (ignored). 
*   - 15
    - `TimeChargeTrigger`
    - real
