# Monitor

(
    Circuit Element,
    Meter Element
)

:::{list-table}

*   - Index
    - Name
    - Type
    - Default
    - Units
    - Description
*   - 1
    - `Element`
    - string<br>*([CktElement](#circuit-elements) name)*
    - Vsource.source
    - 
    - Name (Full Object name) of element to which the monitor is connected.
*   - 2
    - `Terminal`
    - integer
    - 1
    - 
    - Number of the terminal of the circuit element to which the monitor is connected. 1 or 2, typically. For monitoring states, attach monitor to terminal 1.
*   - 3
    - `Mode`
    - integer
    - 0
    - 
    - Bitmask integer designating the values the monitor is to capture: <br>0 = Voltages and currents at designated terminal<br>1 = Powers at designated terminal<br>2 = Tap Position (Transformer Device only)<br>3 = State Variables (PCElements only)<br>4 = Flicker level and severity index (Pst) for voltages. No adders apply.<br>    Flicker level at simulation time step, Pst at 10-minute time step.<br>5 = Solution variables (Iterations, etc).<br>Normally, these would be actual phasor quantities from solution.<br>6 = Capacitor Switching (Capacitors only)<br>7 = Storage state vars (Storage device only)<br>8 = All winding currents (Transformer device only)<br>9 = Losses, watts and var (of monitored device)<br>10 = All Winding voltages (Transformer device only)<br>Normally, these would be actual phasor quantities from solution.<br>11 = All terminal node voltages and line currents of monitored device<br>12 = All terminal node voltages LL and line currents of monitored device<br>Combine mode with adders below to achieve other results for terminal quantities:<br>+16 = Sequence quantities<br>+32 = Magnitude only<br>+64 = Positive sequence only or avg of all phases<br><br>Mix adder to obtain desired results. For example:<br>Mode=112 will save positive sequence voltage and current magnitudes only<br>Mode=48 will save all sequence voltages and currents, but magnitude only.
*   - 4
    - `Action`
    - string<br>*(from enum. [Action](#enum-monitoraction), action)*
    - 
    - 
    - {Clear | Save | Take | Process}<br>(C)lears or (S)aves current buffer.<br>(T)ake action takes a sample.<br>(P)rocesses the data taken so far (e.g. Pst for mode 4).<br><br>Note that monitors are automatically reset (cleared) when the Set Mode= command is issued. Otherwise, the user must explicitly reset all monitors (reset monitors command) or individual monitors with the Clear action.
*   - 5
    - `Residual`
    - boolean
    - False
    - 
    - Include Residual cbannel (sum of all phases) for voltage and current. Does not apply to sequence quantity modes or power modes.
*   - 6
    - `VIPolar`
    - boolean
    - True
    - 
    - Report voltage and current in polar form (Mag/Angle). (default)  Otherwise, it will be real and imaginary.
*   - 7
    - `PPolar`
    - boolean
    - True
    - 
    - Report power in Apparent power, S, in polar form (Mag/Angle).(default)  Otherwise, is P and Q
*   - 8
    - `BaseFreq`
    - real
    - 
    - Hz
    - Base Frequency for ratings.
*   - 9
    - `Enabled`
    - boolean
    - True
    - 
    - Indicates whether this element is enabled.
*   - 10
    - `Like`
    - string<br>*([Monitor](#Monitor) name)*<br>[deprecated]{.fg-warning}
    - 
    - 
    - Make like another object, e.g.:<br><br>New Capacitor.C2 like=c1  ...
