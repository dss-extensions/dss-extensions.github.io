*   - Index
    - Name
    - Type
    - Default
    - Units
    - Description
*   - 1
    - `Element`
    - string<br>*([CktElement](#circuit-elements) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Name (Full Object name) of element to which the Sensor is connected.
*   - 2
    - `Terminal`
    - integer
    - 1
    - 
    - Number of the terminal of the circuit element to which the Sensor is connected. 1 or 2, typically.
*   - 3
    - `kVBase`
    - real
    - 12.47
    - kV
    - Voltage base for the sensor, in kV. If connected to a 2- or 3-phase terminal, <br>specify L-L voltage. For 1-phase devices specify L-N or actual 1-phase voltage.
*   - 4
    - `Clear`
    - boolean<br>*(action)*
    - False
    - 
    - Clear=Yes clears sensor values. Should be issued before putting in a new set of measurements.
*   - 5
    - `kVs`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Array of Voltages (kV) measured by the voltage sensor. For Delta-connected sensors, Line-Line voltages are expected. For Wye, Line-Neutral are expected.
*   - 6
    - `Currents`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Array of Currents (amps) measured by the current sensor. Specify this or power quantities; not both.
*   - 7
    - `kWs`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Array of Active power (kW) measurements at the sensor. Is converted into Currents along with q=[...]<br>Will override any currents=[...] specification.
*   - 8
    - `kvars`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Array of Reactive power (kvar) measurements at the sensor. Is converted into Currents along with p=[...]
*   - 9
    - `Conn`
    - string<br>*(from enum. [](#enum-connection))*
    - Wye
    - 
    - Voltage sensor connection. Applies to voltage measurement only. <br>Currents are always assumed to be line currents.<br>If wye or LN, voltage is assumed measured line-neutral; otherwise, line-line.
*   - 10
    - `DeltaDirection`
    - integer
    - 1
    - 
    - Default is 1: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1. For reverse rotation, enter -1.
*   - 11
    - `%Error`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Assumed percent error in the measurement.
*   - 12
    - `Weight`
    - real
    - 1.0
    - 
    - Weighting factor.
*   - 13
    - `BaseFreq`
    - real
    - 
    - Hz
    - Base Frequency for ratings.
*   - 14
    - `Enabled`
    - boolean
    - True
    - 
    - Indicates whether this element is enabled.
*   - 15
    - `Like`
    - string<br>*([Sensor](#Sensor) name)*<br>[deprecated]{.fg-warning}
    - 
    - 
    - Make like another object, e.g.:<br><br>New Capacitor.C2 like=c1  ...
