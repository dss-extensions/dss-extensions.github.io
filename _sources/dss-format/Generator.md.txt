    - Default
    - Units
    - Description
*   - 1
    - `Phases`
    - integer
    - 3
    - 
    - Number of Phases, this Generator.  Power is evenly divided among phases.
*   - 2
    - `Bus1`
    - string<br>*(bus def.)*
    - 
    - 
    - Bus to which the Generator is connected.  May include specific node specification.
*   - 3
    - `kV`
    - real
    - 12.47
    - kV
    - Nominal rated (1.0 per unit) voltage, kV, for Generator. For 2- and 3-phase Generators, specify phase-phase kV. Otherwise, for phases=1 or phases>3, specify actual kV across each branch of the Generator. If wye (star), specify phase-neutral kV. If delta or phase-phase connected, specify phase-phase kV.
*   - 4
    - `kW`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Total base kW for the Generator.  A positive value denotes power coming OUT of the element, <br>which is the opposite of a load. This value is modified depending on the dispatch mode. Unaffected by the global load multiplier and growth curves. If you want there to be more generation, you must add more generators or change this value.
*   - 5
    - `PF`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Generator power factor. Enter negative for leading powerfactor (when kW and kvar have opposite signs.)<br>A positive power factor for a generator signifies that the generator produces vars <br>as is typical for a synchronous generator.  Induction machines would be <br>specified with a negative power factor.
*   - 6
    - `kvar`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Specify the base kvar.  Alternative to specifying the power factor.  Side effect:  the power factor value is altered to agree based on present value of kW.

Valid values are:<br><br>1:Generator injects a constant kW at specified power factor.<br>2:Generator is modeled as a constant admittance.<br>3:Const kW, constant kV.  Somewhat like a conventional transmission power flow P-V generator.<br>4:Const kW, Fixed Q (Q never varies)<br>5:Const kW, Fixed Q(as a constant reactance)<br>6:Compute load injection from User-written Model.(see usage of Xd, Xdp)<br>7:Constant kW, kvar, but current-limited below Vminpu.

If the generator is assumed to be ON continuously, specify Status=FIXED, or designate a curve that is 1.0 per unit at all times. Set to NONE to reset to no loadshape. Nominally for 8760 simulations.  If there are fewer points in the designated shape than the number of points in the solution, the curve is repeated.

    - string<br>*([LoadShape](#LoadShape) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Dispatch shape to use for daily simulations.  Must be previously defined as a Loadshape object of 24 hrs, typically.  If generator is assumed to be ON continuously, specify Status=FIXED, or designate a Loadshape object that is 1.0 per unit for all hours. Set to NONE to reset to no loadshape. 
*   - 12
    - `Duty`
    - string<br>*([LoadShape](#LoadShape) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Load shape to use for duty cycle dispatch simulations such as for wind generation. Must be previously defined as a Loadshape object. Typically would have time intervals less than 1 hr -- perhaps, in seconds. Set Status=Fixed to ignore Loadshape designation. Set to NONE to reset to no loadshape. Designate the number of points to solve using the Set Number=xxxx command. If there are fewer points in the actual shape, the shape is assumed to repeat.
