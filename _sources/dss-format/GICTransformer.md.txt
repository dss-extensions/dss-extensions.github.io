*   - 2
    - `BusNH`
    - string<br>*(bus def.)*
    - 
    - 
    - Name of Neutral bus for H, or first, winding. Defaults to all phases connected to H-side bus, node 0, if not specified and transformer type is either GSU or YY. (Shunt Wye Connection to ground reference)For Auto, this is automatically set to the X bus.

    - string<br>*(bus def.)*
    - 
    - 
    - Name of Neutral bus for X, or Second, winding. Defaults to all phases connected to X-side bus, node 0, if not specified. (Shunt Wye Connection to ground reference)

    - `kVLL1`
    - real
    - 500.0
    - kV
    - Optional. Voltage LL rating for H winding (winding 1). Required if you are going to export vars for power flow analysis or enter winding resistances in percent.

    - real
    - 138.0
    - kV
    - Optional. Voltage LL rating for X winding (winding 2). Required if you are going to export vars for power flow analysis or enter winding resistances in percent..
*   - 11
    - `MVA`
    - real
    - 100.0
    - MVA
    - Optional. MVA Rating assumed Transformer. Used for computing vars due to GIC and winding resistances if kV and MVA ratings are specified.

    - `VarCurve`
    - string<br>*([XYcurve](#XYcurve) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Optional. XYCurve object name. Curve is expected as TOTAL pu vars vs pu GIC amps/phase. Vars are in pu of the MVA property. No Default value. Required only if you are going to export vars for power flow analysis. See K property.

    - `%R1`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Optional. Percent Resistance, each phase, for H winding (1), (Series winding, if Auto).<br><br>Alternative way to enter R1 value. It is the actual resistances in ohmns that matter. MVA and kV should be specified.

    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Optional. Percent Resistance, each phase, for X winding (2), (Common winding, if Auto).<br><br>Alternative way to enter R2 value. It is the actual resistances in ohms that matter. MVA and kV should be specified.

    - 2.2
    - 
    - Mvar K factor. Default way to convert GIC Amps in H winding (winding 1) to Mvar. Commonly-used simple multiplier for estimating Mvar losses for power flow analysis. <br><br>Mvar = K × kvLL × (GIC per phase) / 1000 <br><br>Mutually exclusive with using the VarCurve property and pu curves.If you specify this (default), VarCurve is ignored.
