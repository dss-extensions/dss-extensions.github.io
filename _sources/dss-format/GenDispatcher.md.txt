    Control Element
)

*   - \#
    - Name
    - Type
    - Default
    - Units
    - Description
*   - 1
    - `Element`
    - string<br>*([CktElement](#circuit-elements) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Full object name of the circuit element, typically a line or transformer, which the control is monitoring. There is no default; must be specified.
*   - 2
    - `Terminal`
    - integer
    - 1
    - 
    - Number of the terminal of the circuit element to which the GenDispatcher control is connected. 1 or 2, typically. Make sure you have the direction on the power matching the sign of kWLimit.
*   - 3
    - `kWLimit`
    - real
    - 8000.0
    - 
    - kW Limit for the monitored element. The generators are dispatched to hold the power in band.
*   - 4
    - `kWBand`
    - real
    - 100.0
    - 
    - Bandwidth (kW) of the dead band around the target limit.No dispatch changes are attempted if the power in the monitored terminal stays within this band.
*   - 5
    - `kvarLimit`
    - real
    - 4000.0
    - 
    - Max kvar to be delivered through the element.  Uses same dead band as kW.
*   - 6
    - `GenList`
    - array of strings
    - 
    - 
    - Array list of generators to be dispatched.  If not specified, all generators in the circuit are assumed dispatchable.
*   - 7
    - `Weights`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Array of proportional weights corresponding to each generator in the GenList. The needed kW to get back to center band is dispatched to each generator according to these weights.
*   - 8
    - `BaseFreq`
    - real
    - 
    - Hz
    - Base Frequency for ratings.
*   - 9
    - `Enabled`
    - boolean
    - True
    - 
    - Indicates whether this element is enabled.
*   - 10
    - `Like`
    - string<br>*([GenDispatcher](#GenDispatcher) name)*<br>[deprecated]{.fg-warning}
    - 
    - 
    - Make like another object, e.g.:<br><br>New Capacitor.C2 like=c1  ...
