    - `Bus2`
    - string<br>*(bus def.)*
    - 
    - 
    - Name of 2nd bus. Defaults to all phases connected to first bus, node 0, (Shunt Wye Connection) except when Bus2 is specifically defined.<br><br>Not necessary to specify for delta (LL) connection

    - string<br>*(from enum. [](#enum-connection))*
    - Wye
    - 
    - ={wye | delta |LN |LL}  Default is wye, which is equivalent to LN. If Delta, then only one terminal.

    - `RMatrix`
    - array of reals<br>*(symmetric matrix)*
    - 
    - 
    - Resistance matrix, lower triangle, ohms at base frequency. Order of the matrix is the number of phases. Mutually exclusive to specifying parameters by kvar or X.

    - 
    - 
    - Reactance matrix, lower triangle, ohms at base frequency. Order of the matrix is the number of phases. Mutually exclusive to specifying parameters by kvar or X.
*   - 9
    - `Parallel`
    - boolean
    - False
    - 
    - Indicates whether Rmatrix and Xmatrix are to be considered in parallel. Default is series. For other models, specify R and Rp.
*   - 10
    - `R`
    - real
    - 
    - Ω
    - Resistance (in series with reactance), each phase, ohms. This property applies to REACTOR specified by either kvar or X. See also help on Z.<br>***Redundant with Z***

    - `X`
    - real
    - 
    - Ω
    - Reactance, each phase, ohms at base frequency. See also help on Z and LmH properties.<br>***Redundant with Z***
*   - 12
    - `Rp`
    - real
    - 
    - Ω
    - Resistance in parallel with R and X (the entire branch). Assumed infinite if not specified.
*   - 13
    - `Z1`
    - complex
    - 
    - Ω
    - Positive-sequence impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: <br><br>Z1=[1, 2]  ! represents 1 + j2 <br><br>If defined, Z1, Z2, and Z0 are used to define the impedance matrix of the REACTOR. Z1 MUST BE DEFINED TO USE THIS OPTION FOR DEFINING THE MATRIX.<br><br>Side Effect: Sets Z2 and Z0 to same values unless they were previously defined.
*   - 14
    - `Z2`
    - complex
    - 
    - Ω
    - Negative-sequence impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: <br><br>Z2=[1, 2]  ! represents 1 + j2 <br><br>Used to define the impedance matrix of the REACTOR if Z1 is also specified. <br><br>Note: Z2 defaults to Z1 if it is not specifically defined. If Z2 is not equal to Z1, the impedance matrix is asymmetrical.
*   - 15
    - `Z0`
    - complex
    - 
    - Ω
    - Zer0-sequence impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: <br><br>Z0=[3, 4]  ! represents 3 + j4 <br><br>Used to define the impedance matrix of the REACTOR if Z1 is also specified. <br><br>Note: Z0 defaults to Z1 if it is not specifically defined.

    - 
    - 
    - Name of XYCurve object, previously defined, describing per-unit variation of phase resistance, R, vs. frequency. Applies to resistance specified by R or Z property. If actual values are not known, R often increases by approximately the square root of frequency.

    - string<br>*([XYcurve](#XYcurve) name)*
    - 
    - 
    - Name of XYCurve object, previously defined, describing per-unit variation of phase inductance, L=X/w, vs. frequency. Applies to reactance specified by X, LmH, Z, or kvar property.L generally decreases somewhat with frequency above the base frequency, approaching a limit at a few kHz.
