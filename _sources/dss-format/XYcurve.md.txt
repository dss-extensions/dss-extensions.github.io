    - Description
*   - 1
    - `NPts`
    - integer
    - 
    - 
    - Max number of points to expect in curve. This could get reset to the actual number of points defined if less than specified.
*   - 2
    - `Points`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - One way to enter the points in a curve. Enter x and y values as one array in the order [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]. For example:<br><br>Points=[1,100 2,200 3, 300] <br><br>Values separated by commas or white space. Zero fills arrays if insufficient number of values.<br>***Redundant with XArray***
*   - 3
    - `YArray`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Alternate way to enter Y values. Enter an array of Y values corresponding to the X values.  You can also use the syntax: <br>Yarray = (file=filename)     !for text file one value per line<br>Yarray = (dblfile=filename)  !for packed file of doubles<br>Yarray = (sngfile=filename)  !for packed file of singles <br><br>Note: this property will reset Npts to a smaller value if the  number of values in the files are fewer.
*   - 4
    - `XArray`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Alternate way to enter X values. Enter an array of X values corresponding to the Y values.  You can also use the syntax: <br>Xarray = (file=filename)     !for text file one value per line<br>Xarray = (dblfile=filename)  !for packed file of doubles<br>Xarray = (sngfile=filename)  !for packed file of singles <br><br>Note: this property will reset Npts to a smaller value if the  number of values in the files are fewer.
*   - 5
    - `CSVFile`
    - string
    - 
    - 
    - Switch input of X-Y curve data to a CSV file containing X, Y points one per line. NOTE: This action may reset the number of points to a lower value.
*   - 6
    - `SngFile`
    - string
    - 
    - 
    - Switch input of X-Y curve data to a binary file of SINGLES containing X, Y points packed one after another. NOTE: This action may reset the number of points to a lower value.
*   - 7
    - `DblFile`
    - string
    - 
    - 
    - Switch input of X-Y  curve data to a binary file of DOUBLES containing X, Y points packed one after another. NOTE: This action may reset the number of points to a lower value.
*   - 8
    - `X`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Enter a value and then retrieve the interpolated Y value from the Y property. On input shifted then scaled to original curve. Scaled then shifted on output.
*   - 9
    - `Y`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Enter a value and then retrieve the interpolated X value from the X property. On input shifted then scaled to original curve. Scaled then shifted on output.
*   - 10
    - `XShift`
    - real
    - 0.0
    - 
    - Shift X property values (in/out) by this amount of offset. Does not change original definition of arrays.
*   - 11
    - `YShift`
    - real
    - 0.0
    - 
    - Shift Y property values (in/out) by this amount of offset. Does not change original definition of arrays.
*   - 12
    - `XScale`
    - real
    - 1.0
    - 
    - Scale X property values (in/out) by this factor. Does not change original definition of arrays.
*   - 13
    - `YScale`
    - real
    - 1.0
    - 
    - Scale Y property values (in/out) by this factor. Does not change original definition of arrays.
*   - 14
    - `Like`
    - string<br>*([XYcurve](#XYcurve) name)*<br>[deprecated]{.fg-warning}
    - 
    - 
    - Make like another object, e.g.:<br><br>New Capacitor.C2 like=c1  ...
