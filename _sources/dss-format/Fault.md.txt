    - Description
*   - 1
    - `Bus1`
    - string<br>*(bus def.)*
    - 
    - 
    - Name of first bus. Examples:<br><br>bus1=busname<br>bus1=busname.1.2.3<br><br>Bus2 automatically defaults to busname.0.0.0 unless it was previously defined. 
*   - 2
    - `Bus2`
    - string<br>*(bus def.)*
    - 
    - 
    - Name of 2nd bus of the 2-terminal Fault object. Defaults to all phases connected to first bus, node 0, if not specified. (Shunt Wye Connection to ground reference)<br><br>That is, the Fault defaults to a ground fault unless otherwise specified.
*   - 3
    - `Phases`
    - integer
    - 1
    - 
    - Number of Phases.
*   - 4
    - `R`

    - Resistance for each phase. Assumed to be Mean value if gaussian random mode.Max value if uniform mode.  A Fault is actually a series resistance that defaults to a wye connection to ground on the second terminal.  You may reconnect the 2nd terminal to achieve whatever connection.  Use the Gmatrix property to specify an arbitrary conductance matrix.
*   - 5
    - `%StdDev`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Percent standard deviation in resistance to assume for Monte Carlo fault (MF) solution mode for GAUSSIAN distribution. Default is 0 (no variation from mean).
*   - 6
    - `GMatrix`
    - array of reals<br>*(symmetric matrix)*
    - 
    - 
    - Use this to specify a nodal conductance (G) matrix to represent some arbitrary resistance network. Specify in lower triangle form as usual for DSS matrices.
*   - 7
    - `OnTime`
    - real
    - 0.0
    - s
    - Time at which the fault is established for time varying simulations. Default is 0 s, on at the beginning of the simulation.
*   - 8
    - `Temporary`
    - boolean
    - False
    - 
    - Designate whether the fault is temporary.  For Time-varying simulations, the fault will be removed if the current through the fault drops below the MINAMPS criteria.
*   - 9
    - `MinAmps`
    - real
    - 5.0
    - A
    - Minimum current that can sustain a temporary fault.
*   - 10
    - `NormAmps`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Normal rated current.
*   - 11
    - `EmergAmps`
    - real
    - 
    - 
    - Maximum or emergency current rating.
*   - 12
    - `FaultRate`

    - Fault.faultrate
*   - 13
    - `pctPerm`
    - real
    - 100.0
    - 
    - Percent of failures that become permanent.
*   - 14
    - `Repair`
    - real
    - 0.0
    - 
    - Hours to repair.
*   - 15
    - `BaseFreq`
    - real
    - 
    - Hz
    - Base Frequency for ratings.
*   - 16
    - `Enabled`
    - boolean
    - True
    - 
    - Indicates whether this element is enabled.
*   - 17
    - `Like`
    - string<br>*([Fault](#Fault) name)*<br>[deprecated]{.fg-warning}

    - Make like another object, e.g.:<br><br>New Capacitor.C2 like=c1  ...
