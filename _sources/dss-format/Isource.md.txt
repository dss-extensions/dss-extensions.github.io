    - 
    - 
    - LOADSHAPE object to use for the per-unit current for YEARLY-mode simulations. Set the Mult property of the LOADSHAPE to the pu curve. Qmult is not used. If UseActual=Yes then the Mult curve should be actual Amp.<br><br>Must be previously defined as a LOADSHAPE object. <br><br>Is set to the Daily load shape when Daily is defined.  The daily load shape is repeated in this case. Set to NONE to reset to no loadshape for Yearly mode. The default is no variation.
