    - Name
    - Type
    - Default
    - Units
    - Description
*   - 1
    - `Phases`
    - integer
    - 3
    - 
    - Number of phases this transformer.
*   - 2
    - `Windings`
    - integer
    - 
    - 
    - Number of windings, this transformers. (Also is the number of terminals) This property triggers memory allocation for the Transformer and will cause other properties to revert to default values.
*   - 3
    - `Wdg`
    - integer
    - 
    - 
    - Set this = to the number of the winding you wish to define.  Then set the values for this winding.  Repeat for each winding.  Alternatively, use the array collections (buses, kVAs, etc.) to define the windings.  Note: reactances are BETWEEN pairs of windings; they are not the property of a single winding.
