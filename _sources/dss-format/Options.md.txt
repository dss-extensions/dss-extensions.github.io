    - Sets the connected kVA allocation factors for all loads in the active circuit to the value given.
*   - `Allowduplicates`
    - Flag to indicate if it is OK to have devices of same name in the same class. If No, then a New command is treated as an Edit command. If Yes, then a New command will always result in a device being added.

    - Array of bus names to include in AutoAdd searches. Or, you can specify a text file holding the names, one to a line, by using the syntax (file=filename) instead of the actual array elements. Default is null, which results in the program using either the buses in the EnergyMeter object zones or, if no EnergyMeters, all the buses, which can make for lengthy solution times. <br><br>Examples:<br><br>Set autobuslist=(bus1, bus2, bus3, ... )<br>Set autobuslist=(file=buslist.txt)
*   - `Basefrequency`

Control actions are executed in order of shortest time to act until all actions are cleared from the control queue.  Use this mode for power flow solutions which may require several regulator tap changes per solution.<br><br>EVENT = solution is event driven.  Only the control actions nearest in time are executed and the time is advanced automatically to the time of the event. <br><br>TIME = solution is time driven.  Control actions are executed when the time for the pending action is reached or surpassed.<br><br>Controls may reset and may choose not to act when it comes their time. <br>Use TIME mode when modeling a control externally to the DSS and a solution mode such as DAILY or DUTYCYCLE that advances time, or set the time (hour and sec) explicitly from the external program. 
*   - `CPU`

Trapezoidal is automatically used for some load-duration curve simulations where the interval size varies considerably. Keep in mind that for Trapezoidal, you have to solve one more point than the number of intervals. That is, to do a Daily simulation on a 24-hr load shape, you would set Number=25 to force a solution at the first point again to establish the last (24th) interval.<br><br>Note: Set Mode= resets Trapezoidal to No/False.

*   - `UEweight`
    - Weighting factor for UE/EEN in AutoAdd functions.  Defaults to 1.0.<br><br>Autoadd mode minimizes<br><br>(Lossweight * Losses + UEweight * UE). <br><br>If you wish to ignore UE, set to 0. This applies only when there are EnergyMeter objects. Otherwise, AutoAdd mode minimizes total system losses.
*   - `Voltagebases`
    - Define legal bus voltage bases for this circuit.  Enter an array of the legal voltage bases, in phase-to-phase voltages, for example:<br><br>set voltagebases=".208, .480, 12.47, 24.9, 34.5, 115.0, 230.0" <br><br>When the CalcVoltageBases command is issued, a snapshot solution is performed with no load injections and the bus base voltage is set to the nearest legal voltage base. The defaults are as shown in the example above.
