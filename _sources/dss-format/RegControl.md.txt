    - integer
    - 1
    - 
    - Number of the winding of the transformer element that the RegControl is monitoring. 1 or 2, typically.  Side Effect: Sets TAPWINDING property to the same winding.
*   - 3
    - `VReg`
    - real
    - 120.0
    - V
    - Voltage regulator setting for the winding being controlled.  Multiplying this value times the ptratio should yield the voltage across the WINDING of the controlled transformer.

    - `PTRatio`
    - real
    - 60.0
    - 
    - Ratio of the PT that converts the controlled winding voltage to the regulator control voltage. If the winding is Wye, the line-to-neutral voltage is used.  Else, the line-to-line voltage is used. SIDE EFFECT: Also sets RemotePTRatio property.

    - `CTPrim`
    - real
    - 300.0
    - A
    - Rating of the primary CT rating for which the line amps convert to control rated amps. The typical default secondary ampere rating is 0.2 Amps (check with manufacturer specs). Current at which the LDC voltages match the R and X settings.

    - 
    - X setting on the line drop compensator in the regulator, expressed in VOLTS.
*   - 9
    - `Bus`
    - string
    - 
    - 
    - Name of a bus (busname.nodename) in the system to use as the controlled bus instead of the bus to which the transformer winding is connected or the R and X line drop compensator settings.  Do not specify this value if you wish to use the line drop compensator settings.  Default is null string. Assumes the base voltage for this bus is the same as the transformer winding base specified above. Note: This bus (1-phase) WILL BE CREATED by the regulator control upon SOLVE if not defined by some other device. You can specify the node of the bus you wish to sample (defaults to 1). If specified, the RegControl is redefined as a 1-phase device since only one voltage is used.
