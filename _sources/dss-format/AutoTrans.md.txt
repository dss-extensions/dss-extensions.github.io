    - `Windings`
    - integer

    - 
    - Set this = to the number of the winding you wish to define.  Then set the values for this winding.  Winding 1 is always the Series winding. Winding 2 is always Common winding (wye connected). Repeat for each winding.  Alternatively, use the array collections (buses, kVAs, etc.) to define the windings.  Note: reactances are BETWEEN pairs of windings; they are not the property of a single winding.
