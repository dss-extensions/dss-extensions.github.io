    - Description
*   - 1
    - `NPts`
    - integer
    - 
    - 
    - Number of points to expect in subsequent vector.
*   - 2
    - `Year`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Array of year values, or a text file spec, corresponding to the multipliers. Enter only those years where the growth changes. May be any integer sequence -- just so it is consistent. See help on Mult.
*   - 3
    - `Mult`
    - array of reals
    - 
    - 
    - Array of growth multiplier values, or a text file spec, corresponding to the year values. Enter the multiplier by which you would multiply the previous year's load to get the present year's.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>  Year = [1, 2, 5]   Mult=[1.05, 1.025, 1.02].<br>  Year= (File=years.txt) Mult= (file=mults.txt).<br><br>Text files contain one value per line.
*   - 4
    - `CSVFile`
    - string
    - 
    - 
    - Switch input of growth curve data to a csv file containing (year, mult) points, one per line.
*   - 5
    - `SngFile`
    - string
    - 
    - 
    - Switch input of growth curve data to a binary file of singles containing (year, mult) points, packed one after another.
*   - 6
    - `DblFile`
    - string
    - 
    - 
    - Switch input of growth curve data to a binary file of doubles containing (year, mult) points, packed one after another.
*   - 7
    - `Like`
    - string<br>*([GrowthShape](#GrowthShape) name)*<br>[deprecated]{.fg-warning}
    - 
    - 
    - Make like another object, e.g.:<br><br>New Capacitor.C2 like=c1  ...
